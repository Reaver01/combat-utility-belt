### New
- Added **Triggler** a trigger management gadget focused on Actor and Token attribute updates. When combined with **Enhanced Conditions**/**Condition Lab** this replaces **Mark Injured/Dead**
- Added macros for adding and removing conditions: 
    - `game.cub.applyCondition(conditionName, token/s, {warn: true/false})`
    - `game.cub.removeCondition(conditionName, token/s, {warn: true/false})`
    - `game.cub.removeAllConditions(token/s)`
- Added the ability to link a Triggler trigger to a macro, executing that macro when the trigger criteria is met
- Added a Condition Lab map for the **Pathfinder 1** game system thanks to `furyspark`!
- Added drag and drop resorting to the **Condition Lab**
- Partial localization support

### Changed
- Massive changes to the **Condition Lab** -- **you will need to reconfigure your Condition Lab mapping**
- Module settings have been revamped. **You will need to reconfigure your settings!**
- Condition Lab now includes three mapping types:
    - *System - Default* - the default condition mapping for the current game system (if one exists)
    - *System - Custom* - an unlocked version of the default mapping
    - *Other/Imported* - an empty/custom map
- Condition Lab mappings can be exported and imported
- Condition lab mappings can now link to the following reference sources:
    - `JournalEntry`
    - `Item`
    - `Compendium.JournalEntry`
    - `Compendium.Item`
- Conditions listed in Enhanced Conditions chat output can now be removed
- Conditions in the Condition Lab have the following additional options:
    - Overlay - condition is an overlay when applied
    - Remove Others - condition will remove other conditions when applied
    - Mark Defeated - when condition is applied, combatants linked to the token will be marked defeated
- Module completely rebuilt to use es6 modules. This should allow for easier and better future updates
- Award XP is now a checkbox on the End Combat dialog and does not require a refresh to enable/disable

### Fixed

- **Temporary Combatants** work again following the changes to hooks in Foundry VTT 0.5.2
- Enhanced Conditions chat output icons have a fixed height
- Reference entries are sorted alphabetically

## Removed
- **Mark Injured/Dead** has been removed in favour of a robust and customisable trigger system (**Triggler**) combined with the existing **Condition Lab**

## [0.9.8] - 2020-03-16
### Added
- Enhanced Conditions now outputs the condition icon in the chat message

### Changed

### Added
- Hide NPC Names now includes a setting to suppress the chat card footer, which can contain sensitive information about the NPC

- Concentrator now includes a setting to automatically add the Concentrating status if you cast a Concentration spell
